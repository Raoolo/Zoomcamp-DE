## Data Warehouses

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores large volumes of structured and semi-structured data from various sources within an organization. It is designed to support business intelligence activities, including analytics and reporting.

Components of a data warehouse:
- Data sources
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
- Staging area
- Core data warehouse
- Data marts
- Metadata repository
- Query and analysis tools

## OLAP vs OLTP

| Aspect | OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) | OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) |
|--------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Purpose | Analysis and decision support | Day-to-day transactions |
| Data updates | Periodic, batch updates | Continuous, real-time updates |
| Database design | Denormalized, optimized for queries | Normalized, optimized for transactions |
| Space requirements | Large (historical data) | Relatively small (current data) |
| Backup and recovery | Less frequent, can be more complex | Frequent, critical for business continuity |
| Productivity | Improves business decision-making | Improves operational efficiency |
| Data view | Multi-dimensional, historical | Current, detailed |
| User examples | Data analysts, executives, data scientists | Clerks, customer service representatives |

## Data Sources and Staging Area

Data sources for a data warehouse can include:
- Operational databases
- External data providers
- Flat files (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Web services and APIs
- IoT devices and sensors

The staging area is an intermediate storage area used in the ETL process. It serves as a buffer between the source systems and the data warehouse, allowing for data cleansing, transformation, and quality checks before loading into the main warehouse.

## Data Marts and User Interaction

Data marts are subsets of the data warehouse, typically focused on specific business lines or departments. They provide:
- Faster query performance for specific user groups
- Customized data views for different business needs
- Improved data security and access control

Users interact with data marts through various tools:
- Business intelligence (BI) platforms
- Data visualization tools
- Ad-hoc query tools
- Reporting software
- Data mining and predictive analytics applications

## BigQuery Overview

BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse solution provided by Google Cloud Platform. 

Advantages of BigQuery:
- Scalability: Can handle petabyte-scale datasets
- Speed: Uses columnar storage and distributed computing for fast queries
- Separation of storage and compute
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Integration with other Google Cloud services
- Support for standard SQL
- Built-in machine learning capabilities

## BigQuery External Tables

External tables in BigQuery allow you to query data stored outside of BigQuery, such as in Google Cloud Storage, without ingesting the data.

Example SQL command to create an external table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `dtc-de-course-431213.ny_taxi.gcs_yellow_cab_data`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'parquet',
  uris = ['gs://mage-zoomcamp-raulo/nyc_taxi_data.parquet']
);
```

This command creates an external table that references Parquet files stored in Google Cloud Storage.

## Partitioning in BigQuery

Partitioning divides tables into segments, making it easier to manage and query your data. BigQuery supports several types of partitioning:

1. Time-unit column: Partition by TIMESTAMP, DATE, or DATETIME column
2. Ingestion time: Partition by _PARTITIONTIME pseudo column
3. Integer range: Partition by an INTEGER column

Example of partitioning by date:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dtc-de-course-431213.ny_taxi.yellow_cab_data_partitioned
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS
SELECT * FROM ny_taxi.gcs_yellow_cab_data;
```

To inspect partitioning:
```sql
SELECT table_name, partition_id, total_rows
FROM `dtc-de-course-431213.ny_taxi.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`
WHERE table_name = 'yellow_cab_data_partitioned'
ORDER BY partition_id;
```

## Clustering in BigQuery

Clustering sorts data within each partition (or within the table if not partitioned) based on the contents of specified columns.

Example of clustering:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dtc-de-course-431213.ny_taxi.yellow_cab_data_partitioned_clustered
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
SELECT * FROM ny_taxi.gcs_yellow_cab_data;
```

BigQuery supports clustering on up to four columns. Columns should be chosen based on common filter and aggregate operations.

## Partition vs Clustering Comparison

| Aspect | Partitioning | Clustering |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Data organization | Divides table into segments | Sorts data within partitions |
| Query performance | Improves performance by pruning partitions | Improves performance by reducing data scanned |
| Cardinality | Best for columns with lower cardinality | Effective for high-cardinality columns |
| Mutability | Immutable | Mutable (auto-reclustering) |
| Cost impact | Can significantly reduce query costs | Modest cost reduction |
| Limitations | Limited to one column | Up to four columns |

## Automatic Reclustering

BigQuery automatically improves the sort order of clustered data in the background. This process:
- Occurs as new data is inserted
- Ensures optimal query performance over time
- Is transparent to users and doesn't affect query availability

## Best Practices for Cost Reduction

1. Use partitioning and clustering appropriately
2. Set up and monitor cost controls (quotas, budgets)
3. Optimize queries to reduce data processed
4. Use cached results when possible
5. Consider using external tables for infrequently accessed data
6. Implement appropriate table expiration policies
7. Use appropriate data types (e.g., INT64 instead of STRING for numeric data)
8. Avoid SELECT * in production queries

## Best Practices for Improving Query Performance

1. Use partitioning and clustering effectively
2. Prune partitions in queries
3. Denormalize data when appropriate
4. Use approximate aggregation functions when exact precision isn't required
5. Materialize commonly used subqueries
6. Use appropriate join techniques (e.g., broadcast joins for small tables)
7. Avoid overly complex queries; break them down if necessary
8. Use appropriate data types and compression

## BigQuery Internals

BigQuery's architecture is built on several key Google technologies:

1. Colossus: Google's distributed file system
2. Jupiter: Google's data center network
3. Dremel: The query execution engine
4. Borg: Google's cluster management system
5. Client interface: Web UI, command-line tool, APIs

These components work together to provide BigQuery's scalability, speed, and reliability.

## Machine Learning in BigQuery

BigQuery ML allows you to create and execute machine learning models using standard SQL queries. Key features include:

- Support for various model types (linear regression, logistic regression, k-means clustering, etc.)
- Integration with TensorFlow
- Automated feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and prediction

Example of creating a model:

```sql
CREATE MODEL `my_dataset.my_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
LIMIT 100000;
```
